This project's gonna have some production quality features like dll based source code, multiple graphics APIs, content pipeline, user-friendly editor, multi-threading, 2 different visual programming languages for programming and shading etc. But these features takes too long to implement because I'm the only developer so this is a multi-year project that it's gonna take 6-7 years to reach the requirements I think.
